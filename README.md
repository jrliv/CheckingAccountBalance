# Checking Account Balance

By <a target="_blank" href="http://jrliv.com/about/">Jae Logan</a>

## Description

A Windows Forms desktop application that displays and updates a checking account balance depending on the type of transaction that is performed. I created this application for a VB.NET class that I completed in community college. I decided to update a few things with the application and share it here on GitHub.

The main thing the program allows you to do is select a transaction type and enter a decimal number as the transaction amount. Then you can click Calculate from the top menu or on the button at the bottom of the form to process the calculation and update the checking account balance. You can also do a few other things like display a summary of the transaction from the menu, change the font and color of the transaction amount textbox from the menu and also clear the transaction amount textbox.

##	Usage

Feel free to do whatever you want with this project. I'm not planning on changing or updating it so I included the executable file. If you're using Windows and you just want to run and play with it you can download and run <a href="https://github.com/jrliv/CheckingAccountBalanace/blob/master/CheckingAccountBalanace/bin/Debug/CheckingAccountBalanace.exe" target="_blank">the executable</a>.
